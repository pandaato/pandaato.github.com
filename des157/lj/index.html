                    <p>I was surprised by the amount of forethought and research that goes into making an effective form. Many minute details, from hiding vs showing a password, to having friendly and clear feedback go into the process of making or breaking an online form. I was also surprised that there’s no security benefit to forms hiding one’s password as bullets, but maybe it was originally intended for privacy in public spaces.</p>
                    <p>One site whose (checkout) form I believe is extremely well done is <a href="https://drop.com/home">Massdrop</a>. The input fields are set up to guide the users eye to the next field as they fill out the form. Their checkout also features varying box sizes that signify fields with shorter inputs. Although the fields have inline labels, the labels move to the top part of the field once the user enters information, so it stays in sight.</p>
