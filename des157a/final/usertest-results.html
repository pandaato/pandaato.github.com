                <h2>Observation: Spacing and Color</h2>

                <p>Many testers felt that the spacing and aesthetics of the page was very well done and purposeful. Two testers commented on adding additional spacing from the footer to the bottom of the page. Another felt that there were two areas of the page that felt crowded, due to text and images being closer together in that section compared to other sections. Many users agreed that they preferred not having the scrollbar, and that the line in the background functioned really well as a signifier that there was more content to explore. There was a split between testers who commented that the black and white background was a little boring, and testers who commented that the black and white helped emphasize the images.</p>

                <h2>Observation: Image Interaction</h2>

                <p>When it came to images, almost all testers tried to click on them after hovering over a few, and were also successful at closing the zoomed in image by either clicking in the background or by clicking the ‘X’ button in the top right. Multiple testers voiced that they wished that clicking on the image prompted a story, location, date, or something else that expanded on the picture’s significance. This came up often due to the fact that I designed the images to look like polaroids, and there is a space for captions. There were also multiple testers who believed that the images were in chronological order.</p>

                <h2>Observation: Text Interaction</h2>

                <p>Multiple testers were under the impression that the line “a story in the making” was a hyperlink and would try to click on it. Other than that, many people felt that the addition of the poem in conjunction to the images gave a poignant experience and helped tell a story. One or two testers asked if clicking on the images was the only interaction that the site had, and said that they thought there would be more. I purposely asked if testers could try to interact with whatever they thought was interactive, in an attempt to figure out what could be added via observation.</p>

                <h2>Moving Forward</h2>

                <p>Contrary to my initial plans, I will not be adding a progress bar nor more blurred images in the background. Many testers revealed that the background did well to not overpower the images, and that the simple design helped with the nostalgic feeling I was going for. I will be shifting images and text slightly to remove some areas of “clutterdness” that a few testers reported, as well as instead bolding the last line as an alternative for emphasizing it. To address adding a bit more interactions with the image and text, I will add dates of when the photos were taken, and plan on having the text slide in when the user scrolls them into view.</p>
