                <h2>CORGI</h2>
                <p>First up is a vinyl sticker of a corgi! My love for corgis began in high school, when my friend bombarded me with pictures and videos on a daily basis. I got this sticker from a coworker as a gift after attending a convention, and it's the first to populate my hydroflask.</p>

            <section id="sticker2" class="hidden">
                <h2>MOONCAKE</h2>
                <p>This is the most recent sticker, given to me by one of my housemates along with a letter. This is in memory of the one time I made snowskin (mochi wrapper) mooncakes  with custard fillings. The process took a good twelve hours and many steps, but in the end the results were worth it!</p>
            </section>

            <section id="sticker3" class="hidden">
                <h2>ANIME</h2>
                <p>I got this sticker after joining DAC (Davis Anime Club) with a friend during my first year. We used to have dinner and attend meetings together, though that lasted for a short while, as classes were tough. Featured are the platelets from Cells at Work.</p>

            <section id="sticker4" class="hidden">
                <h2>SORAKA</h2>
                <p>Also during my first year, I applied and played as a support for one of UC Davis's League of Legends team. We played in the Collegiate Star League and a few other tournaments, and this sticker is  just one of the goodies I received for playing. Featured is Soraka, this is fine edition.</p>

            <section id="sticker5" class="hidden">
                <h2>PIKACHU</h2>
                <p>This one was made by another student who often sold (and ran out) of stickers. Featured is Pikachu drinking boba, two of my faviorite things. I remember buying two since I liked the design so much. When my coworker saw and mentioned how cute it was, I gave her the second one.</p>

            <section id="sticker6" class="hidden">
                <h2>DISCORD</h2>
                <p>This is another sticker that I received for playing in a tournament. Discord is a great app that I use daily to communicate with friends, gain information, and even connect with other students in some of my classes. I've even made a Discord bot that has custom commands!</p>

                <h2>FREEDGE</h2>
                <p>This is a sticker that I got while working. It was a busy shift and someone handed us a bunch to keep and distribute. <a href="https://freedge.org/">Freedge</a> is a really cool project that allows for people and businesses to share leftover food and produce in a public fridge for others to take as needed.</p>

            <section id="sticker8" class="hidden">
                <h2>HACKDAVIS</h2>
                <p>As an aspiring developer, I've definitely attended a few hackathons over the years, HackDavis being the closest and most frequent. My friend and I would attend together in hopes of creating something really cool, though our ideas never achieved fruition.</p>

            <section id="sticker9" class="hidden">
                <h2>CALHACKS</h2>
                <p>We would also attend Berkeley's hackathon, CalHacks. Pre-pandemic, I would spend the night at my friend's apartment, and we would go around and eat super yummy food and snacks. Once, the coordinators secured boba for everyone, but there was so much of an excess that I had four cups.</p>
